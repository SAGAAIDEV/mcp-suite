# MCP Suite - Sprint Development Plan

This document outlines the sprint-based development approach for implementing the MCP Suite system. Each sprint focuses on specific components and functionality, with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria.

## Sprint 1: Base Service and Account Management

**Duration:** 2 weeks

**Objective:** Establish the foundational architecture for MCP Suite by implementing the base service class, account management, and Redis integration.

### User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to create a base service class that all MCP services can inherit from.
2. As a developer, I want to implement account and credential management for services.
3. As a developer, I want to integrate with Redis for state persistence.
4. As a developer, I want to implement service discovery and registration.

### Tasks

#### Redis Integration
- [ ] Set up Redis client connection management
- [ ] Implement secure credential storage in Redis
- [ ] Create state persistence methods for services
- [ ] Add data serialization and deserialization utilities
- [ ] Implement Redis connection pooling
- [ ] Add error handling and reconnection logic
- [ ] Create Redis health check functionality

#### Base RedisModel Implementation
- [ ] Create `RedisModel` Pydantic BaseModel class with persistence capabilities
- [ ] Create Redis connection management and error handling
- [ ] Implement data serialization and persistence methods
- [ ] Create field-level persistence control mechanism
- [ ] Add methods for saving, loading, and deleting from Redis

#### Base Service Implementation
- [ ] Connect to Redis
- [ ] Create `BaseService` class with service registration capabilities Pydantic BaseModel Parent Class
- [ ] Implement class-level registry to track all service instances
- [ ] Add service metadata attributes (ID, name, description)
- [ ] Create service initialization and shutdown methods
- [ ] Add service discovery mechanism
- [ ] Create service validation methods - load from env, check redis for data, set warning if credentials arent set.
- [ ] Implement service state management methods
- [ ] Field attribute to tag which fields will have redis persistence
- [ ] Save and Load data to and from redis

Sprint Goal: The sprint goal is for getting a base service class that has persistent capabilities to save in JIRA and automatic service registration. And this should be used by any service that an MCP tool server call will use. So running Redis, 

#### Account Management
- [ ] Create `Account` class from RedisModel for credential management
- [ ] Implement credential storage and retrieval methods
- [ ] Add account validation functionality
- [ ] Create methods for testing connections with credentials
- [ ] Implement multi-account support for services
- [ ] Add account activation/deactivation functionality


### Acceptance Criteria

- Base service class successfully registers derived services
- MCP Services can be discovered and enumerated programmatically
- Accounts can store and retrieve credentials securely
- Multiple accounts can be created for a single service
- Credentials are securely stored in Redis
- Service state is properly persisted and retrieved from Redis
- MCP JSON can be generated from registered services
- All unit tests pass with at 100% code coverage

## Sprint 2: System Tray Application

**Duration:** 2 weeks

**Objective:** Create the system tray application that serves as the main entry point for users to interact with MCP Suite.

### User Stories

1. As a user, I want a system tray icon that gives me access to MCP Suite functionality.
2. As a user, I want to see the status of MCP services from the system tray.
3. As a user, I want to access service configuration from the system tray.
4. As a user, I want the application to start automatically with my system.

### Tasks

#### System Tray Implementation
- [ ] Set up PyQt/PySide framework for system tray application
- [ ] Create system tray icon with state visualization
- [ ] Implement menu and submenu structure
- [ ] Add service status indicators
- [ ] Create notification system for service events
- [ ] Implement application startup and shutdown logic
- [ ] Add auto-start configuration

#### Service Management UI
- [ ] Create service management interface
- [ ] Implement service enabling/disabling functionality
- [ ] Add service status monitoring
- [ ] Create service configuration access
- [ ] Implement service grouping and categorization
- [ ] Add service search and filtering

#### Configuration Management
- [ ] Create configuration UI for application settings
- [ ] Implement configuration persistence
- [ ] Add import/export functionality for configurations
- [ ] Create default configuration templates
- [ ] Implement configuration validation

#### System Integration
- [ ] Add OS-specific integration features
- [ ] Implement auto-start functionality
- [ ] Create application update checking
- [ ] Add logging and diagnostics
- [ ] Implement error reporting

### Acceptance Criteria

- System tray icon appears and displays correct status
- System tray menu notifys of redis server connection health
- Menu structure provides access to all services
- Service status is accurately reflected in the UI
- Configuration changes are persisted across restarts
- Application can be configured to start with the system
- UI is responsive and follows platform design guidelines
- All interactions are logged appropriately
- Application handles errors gracefully

## Sprint 3: MCP Server Viewer

**Duration:** 2 weeks

**Objective:** Implement the MCP Server Viewer that allows users to see running servers, their tools, and manage credentials.

### User Stories

1. As a user, I want to view all running MCP servers in a dedicated interface.
2. As a user, I want to see the tools provided by each MCP server.
3. As a user, I want to set credentials for services that require authentication.
4. As a user, I want to generate and save MCP JSON configurations.

### Tasks

#### Server Viewer Implementation
- [ ] Create main server viewer window
- [ ] Implement server listing with status indicators
- [ ] Add server grouping and categorization
- [ ] Create server search and filtering functionality
- [ ] Implement server details view
