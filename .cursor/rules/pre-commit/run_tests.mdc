# Test Workflow Rule

## Running Tests

When asked to run tests or fix failing tests, follow this workflow:

1. **Run all tests first** to identify failing tests:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=/Users/andrew/saga/dreamweaver4 uv run pytest <test_path> -v | grep " FAILED"
   ```
   Ignore keyboard interupt warnings

2. **Add coverage** to see what parts of the code are not covered:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=/Users/andrew/saga/dreamweaver4 uv run pytest <test_path> --cov=<module_path> --cov-report=term-missing -v
   ```

3. **Focus on one failing test at a time**:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=/Users/andrew/saga/dreamweaver4 uv run pytest <test_path>::<test_name> -v
   ```

## Fixing Tests

When fixing tests:

1. **NEVER modify production code** to make tests pass
   - If there appears to be an error in the production code, notify the user but still fix the test to match the actual behavior
   - Only suggest production code changes after tests are passing

2. **Read the test and related production code** to understand what's being tested

3. **Make minimal changes** to the test code to make it pass
   - Update assertions to match actual behavior
   - Fix test setup/teardown if needed
   - Correct test inputs/outputs to match expected behavior

4. **Run the specific test** after making changes to verify it passes

5. **Notify when a test is fixed** and explain what was changed and why

6. **Stage and commit changes** after each test fix:
   ```bash
   git add <modified_files>
   git commit -m "Fix test_<test_name>: <brief description of what was fixed>"
   ```
   - Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was fixed
   - Include the test name in the commit message
   - Keep each commit focused on a single test fix

## Achieving 100% Coverage

After all tests are passing:

1. **Identify uncovered code** using the coverage report

2. **Add new tests** for uncovered code paths
   - Focus on one uncovered section at a time
   - Write minimal tests that exercise the uncovered code

3. **NEVER use `# pragma: no cover`** to artificially increase coverage, use it on '__main__' blocks 

4. **Run coverage report** after adding each new test to verify improvement

5. **Continue until 100% coverage** is achieved

## Fixing Coverage File by File

When improving test coverage systematically:

1. **Generate a detailed coverage report** to identify files with missing coverage:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=/Users/andrew/saga/dreamweaver4 uv run pytest --cov=<module_path> --cov-report=term-missing -v
   ```

2. **Focus on one file at a time**, starting with the least covered files:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=/Users/andrew/saga/dreamweaver4 uv run pytest --cov=<module_path>.<specific_file> --cov-report=term-missing -v
   ```

3. **Identify specific uncovered lines** in the current target file:
   - Look for line numbers in the coverage report
   - Understand what conditions or code paths are not being tested

4. **Find existing tests** for the target file:
   ```bash
   find tests/ -type f -name "test_*<target_file>*.py"
   ```

5. **For each set of uncovered lines**:
   - Identify what functionality those lines represent
   - Find or create a test that would exercise those lines
   - Focus on one set of related uncovered lines at a time

6. **If an existing test can be modified**:
   - Add test cases that exercise the uncovered lines
   - Run the test to verify it increases coverage
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=/Users/andrew/saga/dreamweaver4 uv run pytest <test_file>::<test_name> --cov=<module_path>.<specific_file> -v
   ```

7. **If a new test is needed**:
   - Create a new test function targeting the uncovered functionality
   - Name it clearly to indicate what aspect it's testing
   - Run the new test to verify it increases coverage
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=/Users/andrew/saga/dreamweaver4 uv run pytest <new_test_file>::<new_test_name> --cov=<module_path>.<specific_file> -v
   ```

8. **For conditional branches**:
   - Create test cases for each branch (if/else, try/except, etc.)
   - Ensure all conditions are tested (boundary values, edge cases)

9. **For error handling code**:
   - Create tests that trigger exceptions
   - Use pytest fixtures or mocks to simulate error conditions

10. **Verify coverage improvement** after each change:
    - Run coverage on the specific file
    - Confirm the previously uncovered lines are now covered

11. **Move to the next set of uncovered lines** in the same file until file reaches 100%

12. **Commit changes** after each set of lines is covered:
    ```bash
    git add <modified_files>
    git commit -m "Improve coverage for <file_name>: Cover <functionality>"
    ```

13. **Move to the next file** once current file reaches 100% coverage

## Committing Changes

After fixing each test:

1. **Run the test again** to confirm it passes

2. **Commit the changes** with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git add <modified_files>
   git commit -m "Fix <test_name>: <brief description of the fix>"
   ```

3. **Move on to the next failing test**
