Remember to add the `# pragma: no cover` comment for `if __name__ == "__main__"` blocks:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":  # pragma: no cover
    # Code that runs when the file is executed directly
    pass
```

when you see 'next_action' in a mcp tool call result,

call the tool that is specified in it's mcp_tool
and follow the instructions.
If they are general assume, you are using the relevant arguments for the next tool from your previous conversation.

If a tool fails.
'status': <ToolStatus.FAILURE: 'Failure'>
 Make sure you assess the error, fix it, before you run the tool.

 Never run pytest via the cmp line, use the mcp tool run_pytest if you
 have to run a test.
