# Midjourney Webhook Server - Simplified Architecture Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a minimal webhook server designed to receive completed images from Midjourney. The server will provide a simple endpoint that Midjourney can call when image generation is complete, with no persistent storage requirements.

## Core Requirements

1. **Webhook Endpoint** - A public HTTP endpoint that Midjourney can send completed images to
2. **Image Forwarding** - A mechanism to immediately forward or process received images
3. **Public Accessibility** - The webhook must be accessible from the internet

## Component Design

### FastAPI Server

The server will be built using FastAPI for its simplicity and performance. It will have minimal endpoints:

1. **Webhook Receiver** (`POST /webhook/midjourney`) - Receives Midjourney callbacks and processes them immediately
2. **Status Check** (`GET /status`) - Simple health check endpoint

### In-Memory Processing

Instead of storing files, the server will:

1. **Process Images On-the-Fly** - Extract image data from incoming webhooks
2. **Forward to Destination** - Send images to their final destination immediately
3. **Stateless Operation** - Maintain no persistent state between requests

## Processing Options

Without file storage, the server can handle images in several ways:

1. **Direct Forwarding**
   - Forward the webhook payload directly to another service
   - Pass-through the image data without modification

2. **Memory-Only Processing**
   - Process image data in memory
   - Perform any necessary transformations
   - Send processed data to destination

3. **Streaming to Client**
   - Use WebSockets to stream received images directly to waiting clients
   - Maintain minimal connection state for active clients

## Deployment Considerations

### Public Accessibility Options

1. **Cloud Hosting**
   - Deploy to a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)
   - Use a serverless function for maximum simplicity
   - Configure API Gateway or similar for public access

2. **Self-Hosted with Public IP**
   - Deploy on a server with a public IP address
   - Configure domain name (optional but recommended)
   - Set up SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)

3. **Tunneling Services (Development)**
   - Use ngrok or similar for development/testing
   - Provides temporary public URL

### Security Considerations

1. **Minimal Attack Surface**
   - Only expose necessary endpoints
   - Validate incoming payloads
   - Consider basic authentication if supported by Midjourney

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement basic rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Log unusual activity

3. **SSL/TLS**
   - Ensure all communications are encrypted
   - Use valid SSL certificates

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Webhook Server

1. Create basic FastAPI application
2. Implement webhook endpoint
3. Set up forwarding/processing logic
4. Add basic logging

### Phase 2: Deployment & Public Access

1. Containerize the application
2. Set up public hosting
3. Configure domain and SSL
4. Test with Midjourney

## Configuration Requirements

The server should be configurable through:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - `DESTINATION_URL` - Where to forward webhook data
   - `HOST` and `PORT` - Server binding configuration
   - `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging verbosity

## Integration with MCP System

The webhook server will be a lightweight component that:

1. Receives image data from Midjourney
2. Immediately processes or forwards the data
3. Maintains no state between requests

The MCP system would need to:
1. Configure Midjourney to use this webhook URL
2. Be ready to receive forwarded data from the webhook server
3. Handle any necessary persistence or processing of the images

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Logging**
   - Request logging
   - Error tracking
   - Performance metrics

2. **Health Checks**
   - Simple status endpoint
   - Response time tracking

## Advantages of Stateless Approach

1. **Simplicity** - No file system management or cleanup required
2. **Scalability** - Can easily scale horizontally with no shared state
3. **Reliability** - No disk space concerns or storage failures
4. **Security** - Reduced attack surface with no persistent data

## Limitations

1. **No Caching** - Images must be processed immediately or lost
2. **Dependency on Destination** - Relies on destination service availability
3. **Limited Recovery** - No ability to replay or recover lost webhooks
