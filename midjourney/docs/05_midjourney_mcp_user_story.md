# Midjourney MCP Server - User Story

## Overview

This document describes the user experience for interacting with the Midjourney MCP server through a chatbot interface. It outlines the key interactions, authentication flow, and image generation process from the user's perspective.

## User Journey

### Initial Setup and Authentication

1. **Adding the MCP Server**
   - As a user, I open my chatbot interface
   - I add the Midjourney MCP server as a tool/extension
   - The chatbot confirms the MCP server has been added successfully

2. **Authentication Options**
   - I am presented with multiple authentication options:
     - Option 1: Provide a Midjourney API key directly
     - Option 2: Run an installation script that guides me through authentication
     - Option 3: Authenticate through the LLM interface with stored credentials

3. **API Key Management**
   - I can add, update, or remove API keys for Midjourney
   - I can optionally add keys for alternative image generation services
   - The system securely stores my authentication information for future sessions

### Image Generation Workflow

1. **Initiating Image Creation**
   - I chat with the LLM and express my desire to create an image
   - I type: "Use Midjourney to imagine a futuristic cityscape with flying cars and neon lights"
   - The LLM recognizes this as a command for the MCP server

2. **Processing and Initial Results**
   - The MCP server submits my request to Midjourney
   - The chatbot informs me that my request is being processed
   - After a short wait, the chatbot displays multiple image variations (typically 4 variations)
   - Each image is clearly labeled (e.g., V1, V2, V3, V4)

3. **Selecting and Refining**
   - I examine the variations and decide which one I prefer
   - I type: "Select variation 2" or simply "V2"
   - The chatbot confirms my selection

4. **Creating Variations**
   - I can request variations of my selected image
   - I type: "Create variations of this image" or "Make variations"
   - The system generates and displays new variations based on my selected image
   - I can continue selecting variations to refine the result

5. **Upscaling**
   - Once I'm satisfied with an image, I can request an upscaled version
   - I type: "Upscale this image" or "U1" for specific upscale options
   - The system processes my request and returns a higher-resolution version
   - The upscaled image is displayed in the chat

6. **Final Result**
   - The final high-resolution image is displayed in my chat
   - I can download the image or continue the conversation
   - The image remains accessible in my chat history

### Additional Interactions

1. **Checking Status**
   - If processing takes longer than expected, I can ask for status updates
   - I type: "What's the status of my image?" or "Check image status"
   - The chatbot provides information on the current processing stage

2. **Modifying Parameters**
   - I can specify additional parameters when creating images
   - I type: "Use Midjourney to imagine a mountain landscape --ar 16:9 --v 6"
   - The system applies these parameters to my request

3. **Viewing History**
   - I can ask to see my previously generated images
   - I type: "Show my recent Midjourney images"
   - The chatbot displays thumbnails of my recent creations

## Example Conversation Flow

User: I'd like to create an image of a cyberpunk cat wearing sunglasses.
Chatbot: I can help you create that image using Midjourney. Would you like me to proceed?
User: Yes, please.
Chatbot: I'm sending your request to Midjourney to generate an image of a cyberpunk cat wearing sunglasses. This should take about 30-60 seconds.
[30 seconds later]
Chatbot: Here are four variations of a cyberpunk cat wearing sunglasses:
[Displays four image variations labeled V1, V2, V3, V4]
Which variation do you prefer? You can select one by saying "V1", "V2", "V3", or "V4".
User: I like V3 the best.
Chatbot: Great choice! Would you like to:
Create variations of V3
Upscale V3 for higher resolution
Start over with a new prompt
User: Let's upscale V3.
Chatbot: Processing upscale request for V3. This should take about 15-30 seconds.
[20 seconds later]
Chatbot: Here's your upscaled image:
[Displays high-resolution version of V3]
Would you like to download this image or create something else?
User: This looks perfect! I'll save it. Can you also create variations of this?
Chatbot: I'll create variations of your upscaled cyberpunk cat. One moment please.
[30 seconds later]
Chatbot: Here are four variations based on your upscaled image:
[Displays four new variations labeled V1, V2, V3, V4]
Which of these would you like to select?

## Technical Requirements (From User Perspective)

1. **Responsiveness**
   - The system should provide immediate acknowledgment of requests
   - Status updates should be provided for longer processes
   - Image results should be displayed directly in the chat interface

2. **Image Display**
   - Images should be displayed at an appropriate size in the chat
   - Multiple variations should be clearly labeled
   - Images should be high quality and properly rendered

3. **Command Recognition**
   - The system should recognize natural language requests for image operations
   - Simple shorthand commands (V1, U2, etc.) should be supported
   - The system should provide guidance when commands are unclear

4. **Persistence**
   - Authentication should persist between sessions
   - Generated images should remain accessible in chat history
   - User preferences should be remembered

## Success Criteria

From the user's perspective, the Midjourney MCP integration is successful when:

1. They can easily authenticate and connect to Midjourney
2. They can generate images through natural conversation
3. They can view, select, and refine image variations
4. They can upscale images to high resolution
5. The entire process feels seamless within the chat interface
6. Images are displayed clearly and are easily accessible
7. The system responds promptly to commands and provides clear status updates

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - If authentication fails, the system should provide clear error messages
   - The user should be guided through troubleshooting steps

2. **Processing Delays**
   - If Midjourney processing takes longer than expected, the user should receive updates
   - The system should handle timeouts gracefully

3. **Content Restrictions**
   - If a prompt violates content policies, the user should be informed
   - Alternative suggestions should be provided when possible

4. **Service Unavailability**
   - If Midjourney is unavailable, the user should be informed
   - The system should offer to retry or suggest alternatives
