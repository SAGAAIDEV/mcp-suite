# Midjourney MCP Vision Document

## Overview

The Midjourney MCP (Machine Control Protocol) server is a specialized service designed to enable AI agents to interact with Midjourney's image generation capabilities. This service acts as a bridge between Large Language Model (LLM) agents and Midjourney's API, allowing agents to create, modify, and manage AI-generated images without direct human intervention.

## Core Functionality

### Image Generation and Management

1. **Image Creation**
   - Accept and process "imagine" prompts from LLM agents
   - Translate agent requests into properly formatted Midjourney API calls
   - Return image results with appropriate metadata

2. **Image Modification**
   - Support upscaling of generated images (U1-U4 operations)
   - Enable creation of variations (V1-V4 operations)
   - Allow for version switching (e.g., --v 5, --v 6, etc.)

3. **Result Handling**
   - Store generated images with appropriate metadata
   - Provide access to image history
   - Enable retrieval of images by ID or other metadata

## Technical Requirements

### API Design

1. **RESTful Endpoints**
   - `/imagine` - Create new images from text prompts
   - `/upscale` - Upscale existing images
   - `/variation` - Create variations of existing images
   - `/version` - Switch between Midjourney versions
   - `/images` - List and retrieve generated images

2. **Authentication & Security**
   - API key authentication for LLM agents
   - Secure storage of Midjourney credentials
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

3. **Response Format**
   - Consistent JSON response structure
   - Image URLs or Base64 encoded images
   - Detailed metadata including generation parameters

### Configuration Management

1. **Credential Storage**
   - Secure storage of Midjourney API keys
   - Support for environment variable configuration
   - Configuration file support with appropriate permissions

2. **User Interface**
   - Web-based configuration dashboard
   - API key management interface
   - System status and monitoring

## Architecture

### Components

1. **API Server**
   - Handles incoming requests from LLM agents
   - Validates requests and manages authentication
   - Routes requests to appropriate handlers

2. **Midjourney Client**
   - Manages communication with Midjourney API
   - Handles authentication and request formatting
   - Processes and validates responses

3. **Storage Service**
   - Manages persistent storage of images
   - Handles metadata indexing and retrieval
   - Implements caching for performance optimization

4. **Configuration Manager**
   - Handles loading and saving of configuration
   - Manages environment variable integration
   - Provides configuration API for UI


### Data Flow

1. LLM agent sends request to MCP server
2. MCP server authenticates and validates request
3. Request is translated to appropriate Midjourney API call
4. Midjourney processes the request and returns results
5. MCP server processes and stores results
6. Formatted response is returned to the LLM agent

## Implementation Considerations

### Technology Stack

1. **Backend**
   - Python-based API server (FastAPI or Flask)
   - Asynchronous request handling for performance
   - SQLite or PostgreSQL for metadata storage


2. **Deployment**
   - Docker containerization
   - Environment-based configuration
   - CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment

### Security Considerations

1. **API Key Management**
   - Encrypted storage of API keys
   - Key rotation capabilities
   - Granular permission controls

2. **Request Validation**
   - Input sanitization
   - Content policy enforcement
   - Rate limiting and abuse prevention

3. **Data Protection**
   - Secure storage of generated images
   - Access controls for image retrieval
   - Compliance with data protection regulations

## User Experience

### LLM Agent Integration

1. **Simple API**
   - Intuitive endpoint naming
   - Consistent parameter naming
   - Detailed error messages

2. **Stateful Operations**
   - Session management for multi-step operations
   - Context preservation between requests
   - Idempotent operations where possible

### Human User Interface

1. **Configuration Dashboard**
   - Simple setup process
   - Clear status indicators
   - Guided troubleshooting

2. **Image Management**
   - Gallery view of generated images
   - Filtering and search capabilities
   - Batch operations for image management
