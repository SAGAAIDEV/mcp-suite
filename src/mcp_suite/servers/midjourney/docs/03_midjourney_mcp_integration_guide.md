# Midjourney MCP Integration Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidance for implementing a Machine Control Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with Midjourney, enabling AI agents to generate and manipulate images through standardized MCP tools. The integration leverages the webhook server for receiving completed images from Midjourney.

## MCP Server Architecture

### Core Components

1. **MCP Tool Definitions**
   - Define tools for image generation and manipulation
   - Implement handlers for each tool
   - Map tool parameters to Midjourney API calls

2. **Midjourney Client**
   - Handle authentication with Midjourney API
   - Format and send requests to Midjourney
   - Configure webhook URL for receiving results

3. **Result Processor**
   - Receive and process webhook data
   - Format results for MCP tool responses
   - Handle asynchronous completion

4. **Configuration Manager**
   - Manage Midjourney API keys
   - Configure webhook endpoints
   - Set default parameters

## MCP Tool Definitions

### Required Tools

1. **Imagine Tool**
   - Generate images from text prompts
   - Support for version, aspect ratio, and style parameters
   - Return job ID for status tracking

2. **Upscale Tool**
   - Enhance resolution of generated images
   - Reference images by ID
   - Support different upscale options

3. **Variation Tool**
   - Create variations of existing images
   - Reference images by ID
   - Support different variation options

4. **Status Check Tool**
   - Check status of pending jobs
   - Return completion status and result URLs when available

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Asynchronous Processing Model

Since Midjourney image generation is not instantaneous, the MCP tools should implement an asynchronous processing model:

1. **Initial Request**
   - Tool receives parameters from agent
   - Validates parameters
   - Submits request to Midjourney
   - Returns a job ID immediately

2. **Status Checking**
   - Agent can check job status with a separate tool
   - Status includes: pending, processing, completed, failed

3. **Result Retrieval**
   - Once job is complete, agent can retrieve the result
   - Result includes image URL and metadata

### 2. Webhook Integration

The MCP server needs to work with the webhook server:

1. **Webhook Configuration**
   - MCP server configures Midjourney with webhook URL
   - Each request includes a unique job ID for correlation

2. **Result Processing**
   - Webhook server receives completed images
   - MCP server retrieves or is notified of completed images
   - Results are formatted for agent consumption

### 3. Image Representation

Images can be represented to agents in several ways:

1. **URL References**
   - Provide URL to the generated image
   - Requires image hosting capability

2. **Base64 Encoding**
   - Encode image data directly in the response
   - Suitable for smaller images or when hosting isn't available

3. **Multi-part Responses**
   - Return both metadata and image data
   - Allows for rich context about the generation

## Configuration Requirements

### API Key Management

1. **Storage Options**
   - Environment variables: `MIDJOURNEY_API_KEY`
   - Configuration file (with appropriate permissions)
   - Secure credential storage

2. **Key Validation**
   - Test API key on startup
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid keys

### Webhook Configuration

1. **URL Configuration**
   - Set base webhook URL: `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL`
   - Ensure URL is publicly accessible
   - Configure with SSL for security

2. **Correlation Parameters**
   - Include job ID in webhook URL or payload
   - Use consistent parameter naming

## Integration with LLM Agents

### Tool Discovery and Usage Flow

1. **Tool Discovery**
   - Agent discovers available Midjourney tools through MCP
   - Tools appear in agent's available tool list

2. **Image Generation**
   - Agent calls imagine tool with prompt
   - Agent receives job ID
   - Agent periodically checks status
   - Agent retrieves and uses completed image

3. **Image Modification**
   - Agent references existing image by ID
   - Agent requests upscale or variation
   - Agent follows same status checking pattern
   - Agent receives modified image

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Integration

1. Define MCP tool schemas for Midjourney operations
2. Implement basic Midjourney client with API key authentication
3. Set up job tracking mechanism
4. Configure webhook URL for result delivery

### Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality

1. Add support for all Midjourney parameters and options
2. Implement proper error handling and retries
3. Add result caching for efficiency
4. Enhance status reporting with progress information

### Phase 3: User Experience Improvements

1. Add image preview capabilities
2. Implement prompt enhancement suggestions
3. Add support for image-to-image operations
4. Create gallery functionality for browsing generated images

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test tool parameter validation
   - Test Midjourney client request formatting
   - Test webhook payload processing

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test end-to-end image generation flow
   - Test webhook reception and processing
   - Test error handling and recovery

3. **Agent Interaction Testing**
   - Test tool discovery by agents
   - Test complete workflows with agent interaction
   - Validate result formatting and usability

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Scaling**
   - Consider rate limits of Midjourney API
   - Plan for concurrent request handling
   - Implement request queuing if necessary

2. **Monitoring**
   - Track success/failure rates
   - Monitor response times
   - Alert on persistent failures

3. **Cost Management**
   - Track API usage for billing purposes
   - Implement usage limits if needed
   - Consider caching to reduce duplicate requests

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**
   - Secure storage of Midjourney credentials
   - No exposure in logs or responses
   - Regular key rotation

2. **Content Filtering**
   - Implement prompt filtering for policy compliance
   - Consider content moderation for results
   - Provide clear usage guidelines

3. **Access Control**
   - Limit which agents can access image generation
   - Consider usage quotas per agent/user
   - Implement audit logging for all operations
